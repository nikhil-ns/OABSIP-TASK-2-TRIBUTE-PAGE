                <h2>Industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Sons.</h2>

                <p>Ratan Tata studied at Cornell and Harvard universities and started his career by working in the
                    textile divisions of the Tata group. After learning the ropes of the business and showing his
                    potential as a leader, he was given the responsibility of managing the overseas operations of the
                    computer and hotel businesses. It was here that his talent got noticed. In 1991, JRD Tata chose him
                    as his successor despite strong opposition by the senior executives in the company. From 1991 to
                    2012, Ratan Tata grew the Tata group from Rs. 10,000 cr to Rs. 130,000 cr, added 3 more companies
                    and acquired reputed foreign companies. Tata Steel acquired European steel major, Corus, which was a
                    bigger company than itself. Tata motors acquired Jaguar Land Rover which is a reputed British
                    company which makes luxury cars.</p>
